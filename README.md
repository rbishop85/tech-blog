## Demo:

./

---

## Install:

To ensure that the necessary dependencies are pulled down, in this case "Inquirer" for handling command line questions and "mysql2" for dealing with the database, make sure to key in:
```
npm i
```

Before running the app you'll also want to run the schema and seeds file to ensure that you have a starting database to work with.  Make sure to log into mysql and then key:
```
source schema.sql
source seeds.sql
```

---

## Usage:

After dependencies have been loaded, simly key the following into your command prompt to start the app.
```
node index.js
```
Once up and running simply navigate through the prompts.

## Skills/Concepts Used:

* Javascript
  - Node.js
  - Inquirer npm
  - MySQL
  - C.R.U.D. (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

---

## Steps Taken:

- [x] Created repo and installed required dependencies.
- [x] Setup initial schema and seeds files.
- [x] Started working on initial function layout.
- [x] Setup questions for asking user what they want to do and running appropriate function.
- [x] Started separating functions into separate js files for organization.
- [x] Master questions list separated by table user is working in.
- [x] Setup functions for viewing each table's contents.
- [x] Created functions for creating and deleting within each table.
- [x] Added some additional functions for editing employees.
- [x] Moved question lists into array variables and stored them in separate file to clean up index.
- [x] Moved all individual table functions aside from starter questions into their respective separate js files.
- [x] Final format and cleanup, along with adding notes and creating README.

---

## Thoughts/Future Ideas:

Given more time I'd like to add in more functions for editing items already in the tables.  Also I had wanted to work on some checks to make sure people don't accidentally remove data.
